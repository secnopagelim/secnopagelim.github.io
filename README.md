Welcome to the repository of the [SecNoPageLim](https://secnopagelim.github.io) website! 

This repository, and corresponding website, is entirely maintained by myself, [Giovanni Apruzzese](https://giovanniapruzzese.com).

I will try my best to keep the website updated with the most recent information. **The next update is scheduled to happen at around January 2023**. If you notice a mistake, or if you think that I did not include a relevant venue in the list(s), feel free to contact me!

I also welcome any criticism or remark, as long as it is constructive. My [personal website](https://giovanniapruzzese.com) has my full contact details, but you can also post a comment in the [Discussion](https://github.com/secnopagelim/secnopagelim.github.io/discussions) section of this repository.
