title: All Security Venues with No Page-Limit 
tagline:  A long list
description: This webpage lists all (ttbomk) security venues without (and with) page limits
---

This section of the website is an "extended" version of the list in the [homepage]({{ BASE_PATH }}) of this website. Specifically, instead of using just the venues listed by Guofei Gu (44 in total), I will report *all* the venues considered in the [Jianying Zhou's rankings](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html) (117 in total: the top20, and 96 others + SaTML).

These lists will be updated less frequently, due to the larger amount of effort required to keep track of all these venues.

As usual, feel free to [email me](mailto:giovanni.apruzzese@uni.li) if you spot a mistake (e.g., a missing venue), or if you want to "refresh" it sooner. (Last update: October 1st, 2022)

### Venues with NO page limits
The list is provided in the table below. I only included "active" venues, i.e., those for which an event is either planned, or has already been held, in the current year (i.e., 2022---refer to [this document for]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/jianyingZhou.txt) included/excluded).

For each conference that has "unlimited" pages, the table also reports: the link to the most recent CfP, the amount of "base" pages (i.e., those subject to limitations), the template (DC=Double Column), the year in which the venue started to accept unlimited "extra" pages (since 2011), whether the venue accepts Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, and whether the venue has a (dedicated) Artifact evaluation.

**Note:** I will also include venues that accept "unlimited" pages _at the time of submission_, but for which the final paper must fit within a specified limit (e.g., for USENIX Security); such venues are marked with an asterisk "(*)". The ordering of the venues is the same as in [Jianying Zhou's rankings](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html); venues outside of the top20 are listed alphabetically (the only venue reported in this table and not listed in that ranking is IEEE SaTML, since it's completely new).

To the best of my knowledge, the table above includes _all_ "unlimited" venues listed in [Jianying Zhou's rankings](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html).




### Conferences with Page Limits

For completeness, below is a table of those venues (also from [Jianying Zhou's rankings](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html)) that, at the time of writing, **have page limits** for their appendices (if any). For each "limited" venue, the table reports: the latest CfP, the length of base pages, the template, the length of "extra" pages (for appendices and/or references---an asterisk * denotes unlimited pages for references), and whether it accepts SoK and Artifacts.

**Note:** the table below is still under construction and some venues may be missing. Since the priority of this website is on _unlimited_ papers, I will maintain the table below with less effort.
