title: Security Venues with No Page-Limit

description: This website lists all Cybersecurity venues that do not impose any limit to the length of the References/Appendices in the submitted papers
---


### What?

This website contains a comprehensive list of _all_ cybersecurity venues that accept papers without any limit to the amount of pages dedicated to **references** _and_ **appendices**.

#### How?

I simply take all well-known venues (i.e., conferences, workshops or symposia) and check their Call for Papers (CfP): if such CfP specify that there is no limit for appendices/references, then I will list them in this website. Specifically, the list of venues is taken from this source: [Jianying Zhou ranking](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html) (I looked through _all_ the venues listed therein, not just the top20).

### List
The list is provided in the table below. I only included "active" venues, i.e., those for which an event is either planned, or has already been held, in the current year.
For each conference that has "unlimited" pages, the table also reports: the link to the most recent CfP, the amount of "base" pages (i.e., those subject to limitations), the template (DC=Double Column), the year in which the venue started to accept unlimited "extra" pages (since 2011), whether the venue accepts Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, and whether the venue has a (dedicated) Artifact evaluation.

**Note:** I will also include venues that accept "unlimited" pages _at the time of submission_, but for which the final paper must fit within a specified limit (this is the case, e.g., for USENIX Security). These special cases are marked with an asterisk "(*)". The order is completely random.

I will update this list regularly, but feel free to [email me](mailto:giovanni.apruzzese@uni.li) if you spot a mistake (e.g., a missing venue), or if you want to "refresh" it sooner. (Last update: September 30th, 2022)


### Why?
This website was inspired by the "Rump Session" of the 7th [IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/program.html) (held on Wednesday, June 8th). In the few hours before the Rump Session I came up with a "draft" version of the website, which consisted in a simple Google Sheet (accessible at this link: [https://tinyurl.com/noapplim](https://tinyurl.com/noapplim)) that I shared with the attendees of the Rump Session. For various reasons, I decided to "upgrade" such version into a more comprehensive website, i.e., this one.

The main reason is to _help cybersecurity researchers in choosing to which venue_ they should submit a given work---since having plenty of space for appendices may be a deciding factor. To the best of my knowledge, there are no resources that aggregate all such information in a single list.

Nonetheless, there are deeper reasons that motivated me in creating this website, albeit most of them are subjective and stem from my (recent, and arguably little) experience---both as a reviewer, and as an author. Put simply, it is to _send a message to our community_. 
As all such considerations are personal, I will not discuss them here: feel free to read them in the dedicated [blog-post that I made on my personal website](https://www.giovanniapruzzese.com/posts/2022/secnopagelim).


### Conferences with Page Limits

For completeness, below is a table of those (*active*) conferences (listed in [Jianying Zhou ranking](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html)) that, at the time of writing, **have page limits** for their appendices (if any). For each "limited" venue, the table reports: the latest CfP, the length of base pages, the template, the length of "extra" pages (appendices or references---an asterisk * denotes unlimited pages for references), and whether it accepts SoK and Artifacts.  

**Note:** the table below is still under construction and some venues may be missing. Since the priority of this website is on _unlimited_ papers, I will maintain the table below with less effort.
