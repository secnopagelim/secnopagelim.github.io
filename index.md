### What?

This website contains a comprehensive list of _all_ cybersecurity venues that accept papers without any limit to the amount of pages dedicated to **references** _and_ **appendices**.

#### How?

I simply take all well-known venues (i.e., conferences, workshops or symposia) and check their Call for Papers (CfP): if such CfP specify that there is no limit for appendices/references, then I will list them in this website. Specifically, the list of venues is taken from this source: [Jianying Zhou ranking](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html) (I looked through _all_ the venues listed therein, not just the top20).

### List
The list is provided in the table below. I only included "active" venues, i.e., those for which an event is either planned, or has already been held, in the current year.
For each conference that has "unlimited" pages, the table also reports: the link to the most recent CfP, the amount of "base" pages (i.e., those subject to limitations), the template (DC=Double Column), the year in which the venue started to accept unlimited "extra" pages (since 2011), whether the venue accepts Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, and whether the venue has a (dedicated) Artifact evaluation.

**Note:** I will also include venues that accept "unlimited" pages _at the time of submission_, but for which the final paper must fit within a specified limit (this is the case, e.g., for USENIX Security). These special cases are marked with an asterisk "*".

### Why?
**under construction**



#### Backstory

This website was inspired by the "Rump Session" during the 2022 edition of the [IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/program.html).

In particular, during such Rump Session, I gave a talk in which I discussed about the length of papers in Cybersecurity Conferences. Funnily enough, [David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) (the Co-chair of EuroS&P23) said that "the ideal length of a paper is 0 pages", which is something to which I agree with---in principle. Yet, the discussion was very engaging (I believe it lasted nearly 1 hour), and a lot of interesting points were raised by all the participants (h/t to all those who contributed!).

In the few hours before the Rump Session I came up with a "draft" version of this website, which consisted in a simple Google Sheet (accessible at this link: [www.tinyurl.com/noapplim](www.tinyurl.com/noapplim)) 
For various reasons, I decided to "upgrade" such version into a more comprehensive website.
