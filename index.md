What?
=====

This website contains a comprehensive list of _all_ cybersecurity venues that accept papers without any limit to the amount of pages dedicated to either **references** or **appendices**.

How?
=====
I simply take all well-known venues (i.e., conferences or symposia) and check their Call for Papers (CfP): if such CfP specify that there is no limit for appendices/references, then I will list them in this website. Specifically, the list of venues is taken from this source: [Jianying Zhou ranking](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html)

List
=====
The list is provided in the table below.
For each conference that has "unlimited" pages, I will also report the template, the amount of "base" pages (i.e., those subject to limitations), whether the venue accepts Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, the link to the most recent CfP, and the year in which the venue started to accept unlimited papers.





Why?
=====
There are several reasons


Backstory
=====
This website was inspired by the "Rump Session" during the 2022 edition of the [IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/program.html).

In particular, during such Rump Session, I gave a talk in which I discussed about the length of papers in Cybersecurity Conferences. Funnily enough, David Evans (the Co-chair of EuroS&P23) said that "the ideal length of a paper is 0 pages", which is something to which I agree with in principle. Yet, the discussion was very engaging (I believe it lasted nearly 1 hour), and a lot of interesting points were raised by all the participants (h/t to all those who contributed!).

In the few hours before the Rump Session I came up with a "draft" version of this website, which consisted in a simple Google Sheet (accessible at this link: [www.tinyurl.com/noapplim](www.tinyurl.com/noapplim)) 
For various reasons, I decided to "upgrade" such version into a more comprehensive website.
