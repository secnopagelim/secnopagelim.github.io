## What?

This website contains a comprehensive list of _all_ cybersecurity venues that accept papers without any limit to the amount of pages dedicated to either **references** or **appendices**.

### How?

I simply take all well-known venues (i.e., conferences or symposia) and check their Call for Papers (CfP): if such CfP specify that there is no limit for appendices/references, then I will list them in this website. Specifically, the list of venues is taken from this source: [Jianying Zhou ranking](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html)

## List
The list is provided in the table below.
For each conference that has "unlimited" pages, I will also report: the link to the most recent CfP, the amount of "base" pages (i.e., those subject to limitations), the template (DC=Double Column), the year in which the venue started to accept unlimited "extra" pages (since 2011), whether the venue accepts Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, and whether the venue has a (separate) Artifact evaluation.

**Note:** I will also include venues that accept "unlimited" pages _at the time of submission_, but for which the final paper must fit within a specified limit (this is the case, e.g., for USENIX Security). These special cases are marked with an asterisk "*". Moreover, a "ยง" symbol denotes those venues for which only references are unlimited.

## Why?
There are several reasons


### Backstory

This website was inspired by the "Rump Session" during the 2022 edition of the [IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/program.html).

In particular, during such Rump Session, I gave a talk in which I discussed about the length of papers in Cybersecurity Conferences. Funnily enough, [David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) (the Co-chair of EuroS&P23) said that "the ideal length of a paper is 0 pages", which is something to which I agree with---in principle. Yet, the discussion was very engaging (I believe it lasted nearly 1 hour), and a lot of interesting points were raised by all the participants (h/t to all those who contributed!).

In the few hours before the Rump Session I came up with a "draft" version of this website, which consisted in a simple Google Sheet (accessible at this link: [www.tinyurl.com/noapplim](www.tinyurl.com/noapplim)) 
For various reasons, I decided to "upgrade" such version into a more comprehensive website.
